# React Setup and Dependecies
To use react, you first have to download nodejs. React comes bundled within nodejs:
https://nodejs.org/en/

Now clone this repo to your local machine
$ git clone <repo-main>

Go in the /app directory and run the following command to install all the reactjs dependacies:
$ npm install

(We used react-strap and font-awesome for this project)

Now run the react app on your local host using the following command:
$ npm start

Note: If you are missing the react-strap css file run the following command
$ npm install bootstrap --save
$ npm install --save reactstrap react react-dom
